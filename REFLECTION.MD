As always, I started with the HTML. I made sure to structure everything within the form element to ensure each section could be made within. I started with the standard name, and proceeded to add a radio, checkbox, dropdown, text, and email input. I ended the html by adding span under each input to ensure validation can be caught. As for the CSS, I went with a simple form. For the javascript, I began by manipulating the dom to grab the form element and began from there. I proceeded to create an event listener for when the user clicks the submit button. I then created a validation  function that handles and checks each input to ensure that the validation message will show up but to do that I needed to create a display error message that would show the message. All in all, it went through and validation and inputs worked.

With the HTML, I wanted to make sure the form had a nice flow to it and ended off well with the submit and resets. I made sure to learn each input to know how each worked. Before working on CSS and Javascript,  I wanted to make sure my form inputs were being documented properly. From the link provided by the assignment notes, it properly captured each input. For the Javascript, I followed heavily from the demo we learned in class. I went ahead and followed the structure. I made many changes such as changing the node.remove() as it was not printing out my messages onto the form at all. In order to change that, I used the “textcontent = “” “ route to display the message. I also noticed after I completed most of the form that I was to add a function to each validation. This was a main challenge I had which I will go into question 3. As for the rest of the form, I made sure to add a pop up message using the “confirm” function in the case that the user clicked on the reset form by accident.

As per question 2, I had an issue on having each of my validations within the validateForm function being its own function. After multiple attempts and errors, I decided to create multiple functions within the validateForm function in order to follow the instructions for the assignment. However, I found that it might have been unnecessary? Only due to the fact that the form still worked the same. My other challenge was displaying messages under the correct elements. Originally, I had followed the notes and it was displayed at the bottom of the page. I realized I needed to add the field parameter within the event listener and the validateform function.

I would want to try and have each validation be its own function instead of putting it within one function.
